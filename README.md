# JavaScript Warm-Up: Stack

> In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data
> type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
> push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last
> element that was added. -- [Stack (abstract data type),
> Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\))

The goal of this exercise to practice writing prototype methods. As a reminder
of how we use prototypes, we've provided started code including a constructor
function and one completed prototype method. Your job will be to complete the
remaining method.

## Instructions

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Follow the remaining instructions.

Create a custom JavaScript object modeling the stack using a constructor
function and a prototype. Starter code has been provided for you in
[`lib/stack.js`](lib/stack.js).

## Requirements

-   You should be able to create a new stack with `var stack = new Stack();`.
-   Your stack should have two methods, `push` and `pop`.

    -   `push` adds a new value to the stack's storage and returns the stack
        itself.
    -   `pop` removes the most recently added value from the stack's storage and
        returns it.

-   You should not use `Array.prototype.push()` or `Array.prototype.pop()`.

As you work, you may run `grunt test` to check your code against these
requirements.

## Bonus

Pre-fill the stack on instantiation.

```js
var stack = new Stack(1,2,3);
stack.pop(); //=> 3
```

Which parts of each method are side-effects, and which are the "main" effect?
